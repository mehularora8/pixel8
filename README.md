# pixel8
Generate pixel art from an image. Uses Canny Edge detector. 

Motivation:
I stumbled across some beautiful pixel art and wanted to teach myself how to make it. I am also in the process of deciding what tattoo to get next. Thought I'd put the two together and design my next tattoo in pixel art. 

Usage: 
`python main.py path/to/image pixelation_factor`

pixelation_factor (float): Control for pixelation threshold. Higher = fewer pixels
